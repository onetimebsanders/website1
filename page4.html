        <h6>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h6>
        <p>When designing my website, I wanted to build the home page with a header and navigation bar that would be used throughout the site and use a basic colour palette to unify different sections. I wanted a striking backdrop that would change with each page, of which I already have saved down to my computer and have creative licence to use. I wanted to use a custom font which I already had to hand from a brief stint of video editing in some months ago. I have a custom logo/avatar of a panda which I use among my social media that I used in the header and then eyedropped the colours used in the black and white to use through the site.</p><br>
        <p>My article boxes all contain a different set of information or content and have used links to navigate throughout the website. I wanted the navbar to sticky to the top of the screen but I believe that would require javascript which I have zero experience with but may be something I look into soon as my interest is peaking.</p><br>
        <p>At the bottom of every page I have included a small footer to stick to the window at all times.</p>

        <h6>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h6>
            <p>Copyright is a type of intellectual property (I.P.) that covers creative works. This includes website design in relation to visual arts along with paintings and graphic design.</p><br>
            <p><i>Here’s an example to illustrate my point. If you were to write a song about love, and I were to do the same, we would be both within our rights to do so because a person cannot own songs or love. However, if you copy my song you would have infringed on my rights, as the song was my idea. You are well within your right to write your own song. I only own my song.</i></p><br>
            <p>Copyright is automatically protective of creative works meaning you don’t have to register your creation unless there are specific legal requirements or other circumstances. Where an employee might create something during the scope of there employment, it would be the employer that owns the rights to the works, unless you are an independent contractor. Exclusive rights are given to the owner of their I.P. to perform / display publicly, create offshoots or sequels (derivatives), the right to copy and the right distribute.
            This mean that for website design any assets found online could potentially be claimed against unless it has fair use.</p>

        <h6>1.6 Access issues that need taking into account</h6>
        <p>When making a website is important to make sure that it runs in multiple web browsers. There is no use desiginging a website in IE for it to not work in Chrome or Opera so it is important to use files that have ISO standards. Anyone with a visual impairment may not be able to see the images you display on your website so it is important to us alternate text where apropriate. Theme colours and patterns should be suitable for anyone with sight impairment. </p>

        <h6>1.7 The appropriate filetypes for websites</h6>
        <p>HTML files are used to display information on websites. This can be plain text or can add in additional media through hyperlinks. CSS files are increasing popularity to style website with great flexibility and small file size. Photos and images can come in different file types and depending on what the image is for depends on what file type you probably want to use: JPG/JPEGs are used mainly for photos due to the compression rate, PNG files can use transparency however have a larger file type, PNGs are most commonly used for logos. GIFs care great for simple images or animated images. Music used on websites will commonly be a .mp3 or .wav file. Video content most commonly will be MP4, AVI or MPG/MPEG.</p>
