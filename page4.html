        <p>There are always risks when undertaking a project that can impact the quality, delivery and overall success. Some of the most common things from my own experience that can impact a project is scope creep. This is when the requirements for the project have not been fully outlined prior to commencing work. This can cause massive delays as more and more things need to be taken into consideration whilst the deadline is fast approaching. This can link into not having the resources available or the skill set to execute any later addons. Any stakeholders in your project while being your biggest asset, can also prove to increase the risk of successfully completing a project before its deadline. Stakeholders should be kept in the loop at all times to ensure the project stays within the agreed tolerance. Managing expectations is one of the keys to success in managing stakeholders, it is important to understand the time that it will take to complete your project and if there is any cause for delay that you be up front with your stakeholders as to try and prevent any kind of friction.
            Any copyright issues in obtaining suitable resources, the cost of those resources and any security concerns will need to be evaluated to try and prevent any unforeseen delays, costs or blockers.
            Any third party integration and developments in technology can cause huge delays or constant patching and testing as you are not in direct control over it.
            Whatever project you are working on right now is subject to the current marketplace. Someone somewhere has need of your services. If the market should take an unexpected swing, a contingency plan may be required to adjust, whether this to save a project, or to expand into a larger market. Where there is risk there is opportunity. Whilst planning responses to threats to avoid, mitigate and redirect in the pursuit to project completion it is also important to try and exploit, enhance and share any opportunities that may come along.
