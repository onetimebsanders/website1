        <p>Before undertaking any project, a plan must be put in place to understand the objective of what it is you are trying to achieve. As part of that plan you would do an impact assessment on any current IT systems. If the project is not able to be completed with current systems. Anyone that will be dealing with the system will be able to provide an invaluable list of requirements and associated problems with current ways of working. If I was able to quantify the benefits in time saved or cost savings. Once I know the requirements a list of potential solutions can be compiled and reduced on basis of compatibility with current systems e.g. Windows vs Mac compatibility. Once we have our potential solutions we can start trialling them to understand ease of use. </p>
