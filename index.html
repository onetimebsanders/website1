    <p>Welcome to my website. <i>This is an example of speech.</i> I have always had a keen interest in technology and the advances that have been made. Ever since I got my hands on a Sega Mega-Drive in 1992. What could be and would be made possible by technology over the coming decades I think very few people would have been able to even envisage. Not until 2015 did I build my own PC mainly for gaming but for the accomplishment of it as well. Through my professional life I have always been one of the most technically minded people in the room mostly through wild intrigue as opposed to any formal training. I have quite recently, as of July 2020, upgraded my build in the midst of a global health crisis. This is a chance to gain some formal understanding and hone those skills to go along with all the practical knowledge I have gained through raw exposure to technology and digital projects.
