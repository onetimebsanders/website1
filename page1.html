        <h6>1.2 Methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h6>
        <p>Any IT project as with anything must be correctly planned and resourced. To deliver a project you must try to make the process as linear as possible, this can’t always happen due to constraints but will ease the process overall. It is important to understand the requirements and audience so that it can be tailored correctly. It is no good over engineering something if it will take too much time or simply would not be fit for purpose. Being able to work as part of a team with good communication skills is essential in order to develop what it is that is required. Having good time management skills is essential when working to any deadline, in an incredibly competitive marketplace you must also be able to adapt to change as new technologies are constantly being developed. </p>

        <h6>1.4 The risks that might impact digital projects.</h6>
        <p>There are always risks when undertaking a project that can impact the quality, delivery and overall success. Some of the most common things from my own experience that can impact a project is scope creep. This is when the requirements for the project have not been fully outlined prior to commencing work. This can cause massive delays as more and more things need to be taken into consideration whilst the deadline is fast approaching. This can link into not having the resources available or the skill set to execute any later addons. Any stakeholders in your project while being your biggest asset, can also prove to increase the risk of successfully completing a project before its deadline. Stakeholders should always be kept in the loop to ensure the project stays within the agreed tolerance. Managing expectations is one of the keys to success in managing stakeholders, it is important to understand the time that it will take to complete your project and if there is any cause for delay that you be up front with your stakeholders as to try and prevent any kind of friction.

        Any copyright issues my pose a risk in obtaining suitable resources, the cost of those resources and any security concerns will need to be evaluated to try and prevent any unforeseen delays, costs or blockers.
        <br>
        <br>
        Any third-party integration and developments in technology can cause huge delays or constant patching and testing as you are not in direct control over it.

        Whatever project you are working on right now is subject to the current marketplace. Someone somewhere has need of your services. If the market should take an unexpected swing, a contingency plan may be required to adjust, whether this to save a project, or to expand into a larger market. Where there is risk there is opportunity. Whilst planning responses to threats to avoid, mitigate and redirect in the pursuit to project completion it is also important to try and exploit, enhance and share any opportunities that may come along.</p>

        <h6>1.5 How I would go about selecting and using IT systems and software.</h6>
        <p>Before undertaking any project, a plan must be put in place to understand the objective of what it is you are trying to achieve. As part of that plan you would do an impact assessment on any current IT systems. If the project is not able to be completed with current systems. Anyone that will be dealing with the system will be able to provide an invaluable list of requirements and associated problems with current ways of working. If I was able to quantify the benefits in time saved or cost savings. Once I know the requirements a list of potential solutions can be compiled and reduced on basis of compatibility with current systems e.g. Windows vs Mac compatibility. Once we have our potential solutions, we can start trialling them to understand ease of use.

            <h6>1.7 Legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects.</h6>
            <p>Companies in the UK are under strict guidelines of how they manage data under GDPR legislation.  It is important when working with any level of data that GDPR guidelines are always adhered to.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="
                http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9565-2015-INIT/en/pdf"> “The twofold aim of the Regulation is to enhance data protection rights of individuals and to improve business opportunities by facilitating the free flow of personal data in the digital single market.”</a>
                While most cloud-based data management solutions keep a close eye on your security it is vital that permissions, ownerships and data versions are monitored on a consistent and regular basis. In my own experience working in HR when GDPR guidelines were produced this presented many challenges that had to be addressed prior to the implementation date in 2018. Project teams were erected in development, cyber security and IT to tackle the GDPR risks the company was facing. Every process and procedure had to be scrutinised to ensure customers data was not being collected and stored without consent. Where data is held it must be kept safely and securely as to not be in breach of guidelines. A requirement must be provided for any request for information and only information asked for must be provided. This can have implications where sensitive information is kept in shared locations. Logging systems are essential in cases where liability must be determined. GDPR must be at the forefront of everyone’s mind when considering a project regarding the guidelines are met as the consequences for any data breach have the potential to irreparably damage a company financially and through lack of public trust. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/CFEUZRAbc8I?t=3">Data is king.</a></p>
