        <h6>3.2 Ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h6>
        <p>There are always ways to increase productivity through technology there are advantages to be taken care of in almost any business. The latest hardware, software and IT tools will make it easier to be more productive and efficient.
        <br>
        <br>
        Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of your team match skills to certain tasks. By dividing up key responsibilities and delegating tasks to set times of the day or to utilize talents of different team members. When designing a website for example, design, coding and content, three different responsibilities which could be delegated to different people. On a solo project different tasks can be reviewed at different times of the day to inspire creativity. There is always an opportunity to improve communication techniques, if that be written, verbal or non-verbal, different people with unique temperaments require bespoke communication styles that can constantly be adjusted to increase efficiency. You will see in any team that has worked together for an extended time a cohesiveness that is rare to find between unaligned peoples. We are all goal oriented; it is important to set realistic and attainable goals, that are clear and realistic, so that they might be able to work toward. Where small tedious tasks need to be taken care of people tend to not put enough time or effort into more important tasks. Eliminating excess can give free up time and increase efficiency. Where it is possible, extra incentives could be introduced to drive productivity. Even where this is just a call out for some good work done among peers, it can go a long way to boosting team morale so that the example can be set for what is expected for recognition.</p><a class=source href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2017/02/improve-team-efficiency-productivity.html">Source</a></div>

        <h6>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h6>
        <p>I always try to set a good example for any group I am working with, thatâ€™s just how I am built. However, I struggle with organisational skills and time management. I could have better utilised the Trello board for planning out the site from scratch. Allowing separate time for different tasks would have improved my efficiency as I try to spin all the plates when I should be solely focused on one task. I think I made good use of Slack to communicate with other people however I can let this become a distraction, especially with new people. In future, and always, I struggle to pull myself from the brink of distraction.</p></div>

        <h6>3.4 How I you would go about testing digital solutions</h6>
        <p>Testing any digital solutions is a lengthy and ultimately ongoing task. From development and implementation right through to incident management. However, we can easily break this down. Any digital solution must be tested for basic functionality to ensure that the product or service can deliver the requirements, commonly referred to as alpha testing.
        <br>
        <br>
        The second stage of testing, commonly referred to as the beta test phase would be integrity testing, which involves testing the independent solution against other software packages that are currently being used to ensure the package works in the intended environment. Stress testing to ensure that the solution can withstand peak workflows can be completed in house or extended to a small population which also where you can evaluate user experience to ensure form meets function.</p></div>
