        <h6>2.1 The ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed</h6>
        <p>VS Code is my new life. I love it with the very fibre of my being. The dark mode theme by default is what I come to expect from a software package in 2020. The validation to distinguish between variables, strings, integers etc. makes it easy to work with and identify basic syntax errors. In that way it makes it easy to learn as opposed to basic text where finding one out of place character might take all day. The UI feels super clean, the file management, being able to have multiple documents side by side when working in HTML and CSS, this was a game changer. Extensions are great. I love extensions and customisability. Live Server was the first and surely not the last, not having to F5 my website whilst editing the code is real nice.

        Trello, I’m not really sure if I enjoy. I can see the advantages when working on larger project with multiple moving parts and for collaboration like we did in week 2 on the game that we built. However, for me, it was just another thing to update for myself and to show my working, which is just paperwork at the end of the day. And no one enjoys paperwork. </p></div>

        <h6>2.2 Were the IT tools selected appropriate</h6>
        <p>VS Code was brilliant. I can’t get enough of it. I don’t have anything to compare it to. It would be as if a Philips head was an appropriate tool for a Philips head screw. This is the tool to make a website. I guess there may be different types of screwdriver, that I have no experience or knowledge of, but VS code just felt good in my hands. Does that even make sense? I hope so.

        Working on my own I didn’t feel that Trello was appropriate. The purpose of Trello is for a team or project manager to track progress in a pseudo live environment. Whilst the UI is intuitive in design, when not working as part of a team or reporting to a I would much rather keep my own notes physically next to me when working on a project. I used VS code to quickly take notes of where I was up to rather than tab over to Trello.</p></div>

        <h6>2.3 The strengths and weaknesses of my final project</h6>
        <p>I really enjoyed building the website. Seeing it come together as I made minor changes to it was super satisfying. I’m happy with my website that I was able to create something however there are many things I would like to do to make it feel more like a website from 2020. As this my first formal introduction to coding there was a lot of trial and error on what I feel are really basic things, e.g. changing text colours, aligning headers and articles. My website is ok, but there’s work to be done.</p></div>
    <div class=article>
        <h6>2.4 Further improvements you can make to my website</h6>
        <p>I would like to make the website more dynamic for different screen sizes and devices. Collapsing menus was something I would have liked to add but fast ran out of time. I would have liked to arrange the website to be more aesthetically pleasing and have more interactions. I was wanting to include icons for social media links and have the contact us page submit an email from the form but it seems that would require javascript or php which I don’t feel ready to dive into yet. I also wanted the nav bar to be sticky as you scrolled down the page.</p></div>

        <h6>2.5 Outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.</h6>
        <p>In developing a website to show what I have learned across html and css coding languages I believe I have displayed a competent understanding of how to design and publish a website. There were of course some things that I would have spend more time on to gain better understanding but I think with experience and confidence in the knowledge I have gained I would be able to improve in the areas I feel lacking. There were some design elements that I could not quite understand due to lack of time to gain understanding, but this is just part of understanding for myself.</p></div>
