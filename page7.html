        <h5>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h5>
        <p>When designing my website, I wanted to build the home page with a header and navigation bar that would be used throughout the site and use a basic colour palette to unify different sections. I wanted a striking backdrop that would change with each page, of which I already have saved down to my computer and have creative licence to use. I wanted to use a custom font which I already had to hand from a brief stint of video editing in some months ago. I have a custom logo/avatar of a panda which I use among my social media that I used in the header and then eyedropped the colours used in the black and white to use through the site.</p><br>
        <p>My article boxes all contain a different set of information or content and have used links to navigate throughout the website. I wanted the navbar to sticky to the top of the screen but I believe that would require javascript which I have zero experience with but may be something I look into soon as my interest is peaking.</p>

        <h5>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h5>
        <p>HTML files are used to display information on websites. This can be plain text or can add in additional media through hyperlinks. CSS files are increasing popularity to style website with great flexibility and small file size. Photos and images can come in different file types and depending on what the image is for depends on what file type you probably want to use: JPG/JPEGs are used mainly for photos due to the compression rate, PNG files can use transparency however have a larger file type, PNGs are most commonly used for logos. GIFs care great for simple images or animated images. Music used on websites will commonly be a .mp3 or .wav file. Video content most commonly will be MP4, AVI or MPG/MPEG.
